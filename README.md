# House Price Prediction
 
During This Project, we are supposed to find or predict the price of a house given With various scenarios.

the scenarios can be based on something like knowing the median income of a person the age of the house, the number of rooms that are available, and What is the population in that particular area.

Also, Have Used feature engineering. consider we are given latitude and longitudes. but, these latitude and longitudes are just numbers we cannot use these latitudes and longitudes to predict which city or which area the house is located at. but we have multiple python libraries using which we can generate or we can find out where exactly is this latitude and longitude. so we used this feature engineering to generate new data and apart from that we can use our actual data set and predict the various prices that can be given out for our particular model
